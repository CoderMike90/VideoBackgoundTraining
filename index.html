        <h1>I must say:</h1>
          <p>It is just training element. On Github I uploaded singular topics, features, mini-websites which I learn everyday. So I didn't focused on RWD, big sections, forms, navbars, etc. Maybe I will reuse some of them if I will need :) It isn't my portfolio. It is my playground where you can see what I learned already.</p>
